Analog Clock Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Analog Clock

This repository contains a simple analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It's a fun and educational project that demonstrates how to create a dynamic and visually appealing clock on a web page.

Features

1.Analog Clock Display: The clock displays the current time using hour, minute, and second hands, just like a traditional analog clock.

2.Real-Time Updates: The clock updates in real-time to reflect the current time, making it a functional timekeeping tool.

3.Responsive Design: The clock is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring it looks good on various devices.

How It Works

The analog clock is created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

Here's how it works:

1.HTML: The HTML file defines the structure of the clock, including the clock face and the hour, minute, and second hands.

2.CSS: CSS is used to style the clock, including the colors, sizes, and positioning of the clock components.

3.JavaScript: JavaScript powers the clock's functionality. It calculates the current time and updates the rotation of the clock hands accordingly. 
The setInterval function is used to ensure that the clock updates in real-time.

Try It Out

You can experience the analog clock by opening the https://github.com/SANKARGITH/web_pages file in your web browser. 
Watch as the clock's hands move to reflect the current time.

Customization

Feel free to customize the clock to suit your preferences. You can change the colors, sizes, or even add additional features to the clock. 
This project serves as a starting point for learning web development and creating interactive web applications.
